#   datr.open.soure/qmake

    The qmake directory holds the build procedures for creating 
    Qt applications.  It assumes that it will compile against the
    header files in ../common and link against the object library at
    ../linux/obj/libdatr.open.source.

    The build procedures search ../qt for source code.
