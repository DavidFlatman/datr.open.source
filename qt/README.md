#   datr.open.source/qt

    The qt directory holds code that is aware of, or depends on, the Qt 
    framework.

    Images can be added to the qt/images directory.  If more organization is
    needed, additional subdirectories under the qt/images directory can be
    created and then added to the makeconfig script.
